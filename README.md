# Lowtone Framework for WordPress

Provides ORM, autoloading, extended classes for creating DOM documents, creating forms using OOP, a base class for easy implementation of modules in plugins (or anywhere else) and more.

Requires the [lowtone-content](https://github.com/lowtone/lowtone-content) plugin to be installed.

## Object-Relational Mapping

For [Object-Relational Mapping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) (or ORM) the library uses the `lowtone\db\records\Record` class.

More information about the `Record` class can be found [here](db/records).
